# akshayconfig
A quick way to set up your new computer. I have used all sorts of software in my work as a computer science student and a
software developer. Configuring all of this when you get a new computer (personal or work) can be very tiring and cumbersome.

Not to worry, I have written scripts to automate most of the setup process!

Please feel free to use this to speed up your setup, and if you have any ideas about how to improve the scripts or the setup, 
please feel free to open up a pull request and share it with me! 

Let's eliminate as much overhead of the setup process as we can and get back to what we coders do best: writing code! 

# Get started
Clone this repo, then enter the repo's main directory, then enter the directory corresponding to your type of computer. 

To see detailed instructions on how to use this software, follow the instructions outlined in the prestart.txt, onstart.txt,
and poststart.txt documents.

To get started right away execute the onstart.sh script (the command is ./onstart.sh) to install everything and then execute the poststart.sh script (the command is ./poststart.sh) to verify all the installations.
