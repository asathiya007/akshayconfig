# quickconfig
A quick way to set up your new computer. I have used all sorts of software in my work as a computer science student and a
software developer. Configuring all of this when you get a new computer (personal or work) can be very tiring and cumbersome.

Not to worry, I have written shell scripts to automate most of the setup process!

Please feel free to use this to speed up your setup. If you have any ideas about how to improve the scripts or the setup, 
please feel free to open up a pull request and share it with me! 

Let's eliminate as much overhead of the setup process as we can and get back to what we coders do best: writing code! 

# Get started (Mac)
1. Clone this repo, then enter the repo's main directory, then enter the directory corresponding to your type of computer. 
2. To add helpful command line features for Git, copy and paste the contents from the bash_profile.txt file into your machine's ~/.bash_profile file. 
3. Execute the onstart.sh script (the command is ./onstart.sh) to install software. 
4. Execute the poststart.sh script (the command is ./poststart.sh) to verify all the installations.
