# akshayconfig
A quick way to set up your new computer. I have used all sorts of software in my work as a computer science student and a
software developer. Configuring all of this when you get a new computer (personal or work) can be very tiring and cumbersome.

Not to worry, I have written scripts to automate most of the setup process!

Please feel free to use this to speed up your setup, and if you have any ideas about how to improve the scripts or the setup, 
please feel free to open up a pull request and share it with me! 

Let's eliminate as much overhead of the setup process as we can and get back to what we coders do best: writing code! 

To see detailed instructions on how to use this software, follow the instructions outlined in these documents
prestart.txt
onstart.txt
poststart.txt

TLDR: 
Clone this repo, and run these commands:
$ ./onstart.sh
$ ./poststart.sh
